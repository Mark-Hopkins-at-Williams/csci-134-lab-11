This repository contains *several* starter files for the code
you need to write for HW 12:
- `util.py`: Put code for Question 1 in this file.
- `morse.py`: Put code for Questions 2-4 in this file.
- `semaphore.py`: Put code for Questions 5-6 in this file.
- `braille.py`: Put code for Questions 7 in this file.
- `laboratory.py`: Put code for Questions 8-9 in this file.

There are also two text files that can be used
for testing Question 9. These are located in the `docs`
directory.

Ignore (but do not delete!!!) the other files in this repository.
